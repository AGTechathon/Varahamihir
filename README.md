<h1>Title :- StressAway The Portable massager and Blood pressre checker </h1>


<h2>Discription</h2>

<h4>ABSTRACT</h4><br>

Concept of a making massager using digital blood pressure machine is initiated after understanding the concerns of old age people, during menstruation cycle of female or handicapped people who are not able to help themselves at the time when hand or leg is under sevier pain
This project presents the development of a novel, multi-functional personal health device that ingeniously combines the essential features of a digital blood pressure monitor with therapeutic compression massage capabilities. Recognizing the growing need for convenient and affordable self-care solutions, the device leverages the well-established principle of intermittent pneumatic compression. By adapting the automated inflation and deflation mechanism of a standard blood pressure cuff, the prototype provides accurate Oscillo metric blood pressure measurements alongside rhythmic muscle compression for relaxation and improved circulation.
The core aim was to create a handy, easy-to-use, and cost-effective unit, addressing the market gap for integrated health tools. The developed prototype successfully demonstrates dual functionality, proving the feasibility of repurposing diagnostic technology for therapeutic application. This innovation offers users a seamless way to monitor vital signs and alleviate muscle discomfort within a single, portable device, laying a strong foundation for future advancements in integrated personal healthcare.

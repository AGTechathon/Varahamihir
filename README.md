Title :- StressAway The Portable massager and Blood pressre checker
Discription
ABSTRACT

Concept of a making massager using digital blood pressure machine is initiated after understanding the concerns of old age people, during menstruation cycle of female or handicapped people who are not able to help themselves at the time when hand or leg is under sevier pain This project presents the development of a novel, multi-functional personal health device that ingeniously combines the essential features of a digital blood pressure monitor with therapeutic compression massage capabilities. Recognizing the growing need for convenient and affordable self-care solutions, the device leverages the well-established principle of intermittent pneumatic compression. By adapting the automated inflation and deflation mechanism of a standard blood pressure cuff, the prototype provides accurate Oscillo metric blood pressure measurements alongside rhythmic muscle compression for relaxation and improved circulation. The core aim was to create a handy, easy-to-use, and cost-effective unit, addressing the market gap for integrated health tools. The developed prototype successfully demonstrates dual functionality, proving the feasibility of repurposing diagnostic technology for therapeutic application. This innovation offers users a seamless way to monitor vital signs and alleviate muscle discomfort within a single, portable device, laying a strong foundation for future advancements in integrated personal healthcare.

Costing
COST ESTIMATION Components (Approximate Cost: â‚¹ 2,000 - â‚¹ 3,000)

â€¢ Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, STM32F103C8T6, or Arduino-compatible board): â‚¹ 350 o Rationale: A mid-range microcontroller is needed for processing sensor data, controlling the pump, managing the display, and running both BP and massage algorithms. â€¢ Pressure Sensor (for blood pressure measurement, e.g., MPS2012 or similar): â‚¹ 250 o Rationale: A precise and stable pressure sensor is critical for accurate blood pressure readings. â€¢ Miniature Air Pump (Diaphragm pump for medical/BP applications): â‚¹ 150 o Rationale: A small, low-power pump capable of inflating the cuff to required pressures (around 180-200 mmhg for BP, potentially lower for massage). Medical-grade mini-pumps tend to be more expensive. â€¢ Solenoid Valve (for pressure release): â‚¹ 150 o Rationale: A fast-acting valve is needed for controlled deflation during blood pressure measurement and rapid release for massage cycles. â€¢ Display Unit (e.g., 16x2 LCD or small OLED/TFT display): â‚¹ 120 o Rationale: For displaying blood pressure readings, pulse rate, and massage mode status. â€¢ Battery (Li-ion 3.7V/18650 cell + charger module): â‚¹ 60 o Rationale: For portable operation. Battery capacity will depend on expected usage time. â€¢ Power Management ics (ldos, DC-DC converters if needed): â‚¹ 80 â€¢ Relay ; â‚¹ 77 â€¢ Miscellaneous Components (Resistors, Capacitors, Diodes, Transistors, Connectors, Wires, Buttons, leds, Buzzer): â‚¹ 200 â€¢ Arduino; â‚¹ 900 7.2. Mechanical Components & Fabrication - â€¢ Inflatable Cuff (Standard adult arm cuff, likely reusable NIBP cuff): â‚¹ 180 o Rationale: The core mechanical component for both functions. â€¢ Custom Enclosure (3D Printed for prototyping): â‚¹ 120 (depending on size, material, and complexity, typically â‚¹ 7-20/gram for FDM printing) o Rationale: A custom housing to integrate all components securely and ergonomically. For a final year project, 3D printing is a cost-effective prototyping method. â€¢ Tubing and Connectors (Medical-grade silicone tubing, quick-connect fittings): â‚¹ 60 o Rationale: To connect the pump, valve, and cuff. â€¢ PCB Fabrication (Small batch, 2-layer PCB): â‚¹ 120 o Rationale: Professional fabrication for a cleaner and more reliable circuit than breadboards/perfboards. This might be for 2-3 prototype boards. C. Miscellaneous & Contingency (Approximate Cost: â‚¹ 500 ) â€¢ Consumables (Solder, flux, cleaning agents, adhesives, sandpaper) â€¢ Tools (if not already owned/provided by lab - e.g., small hand tools, multimeter) â€¢ Documentation & Report Printing/Binding. â€¢ Contingency (20-30% of total estimated cost) o Rationale: Essential for unexpected costs, component failures, or design changes.
